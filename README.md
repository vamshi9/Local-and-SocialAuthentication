>Your application is useless without dependencies so how do we install these dependencies?

   Before installation make sure *npm* works fine otherwise installation will be resulting in bunch of errors.If you don't know how to install node-express go through [Derek Benas express and mongo tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSpxyVx5XcprEgvhJ1BzruD) video.I love his videos more than any other online tutorial
   
   open command prompt set the path and type *npm install dependency --save* which directly saves into your package.json file
   
>Following are the dependencies we need to install.
